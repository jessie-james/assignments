                <p>The adolescent and young adult brain has an overwhelming preoccupation to be accepted by their friends. This desire for acceptance means everything to them.
                    Why? A young man’s brain has what is known as the <span>“dopamine push.”</span> This excessive dopamine and lack of pre-frontal control within the brain makes it almost impossible for an adolescent or young adults  not to be dramatically influenced by friends and negative peer culture.
                    Drugs and acceptance by friends are almost inseparable. Therefore, the larger the group = less influence by parents, therapists, and teachers.</p>
                <p>It is Through our small Groups that Our life coaches can to form lasting relationships with our students. Additionally, smaller groups mean we can individualize and streamline education, therapy, vocational skills.
                    The Live Strong House 3:1 model provides the best setting for students to gain great influence, receive personalized attention, and make long-lasting change.</p>

                <p> We feel it is important for students to serve and be part of a larger community and to participate in outdoor recreation. We don’t live in a bubble, and neither do our students. This exposure builds grit, resilience, and empathy.</p>
                <p>At Live Strong House, we play a lot. Play is an essential part of mental health and a great way to challenge your son to step outside his comfort zone. Our program is based in beautiful Northern Utah and provides access to some of the most scenic and rugged landscapes in the world, all within minutes or a few hours’ drive.
                   Our students will water ski, snow ski, rock climb, mountain bike, hike, explore, and get outside. Live Strong House is an active program, because we believe that being active is an essential part of recovery.</p></div>
