                <header>THE ROAD TO <span id="enlight"> ENLIGHTENMENT</span> </header>
                <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <span class="undrline">DOMs</span>, broken
                <span class="undrline">CSS</span> support, and abandoned browsers.</p>

                <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts
                of folk like the <span class="undrline">W3C,</span> <span class="undrline">WASP,</span> and the major browser creators.</p>

                <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to
                see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one
                with the web.</p>

                <header>SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</header>
                <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <span class="undrline">CSS</span>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and
                encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one
                will load the style sheet into this very page. The <span class="undrline">HTML</span> remains the same, the only thing that has
                changed is the external <span class="undrline">CSS</span> file. Yes, really.</p>

                <p><span class="undrline">CSS</span> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be
                illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins
                are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have
                contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>

                <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong <span class="undrline">CSS</span> skills are
                necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even CSS novices can use them as
                starting points. Please see the <span class="blue"><span class="undrline">CSS</span> Resource Guide</span> for advanced tutorials and tips on working with <span class="undrline">CSS</span>.</p>

                <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <span class="undrline">HTML</span>. This may seem daunting at first if
                you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files
                as a guide.</p>

                <p>Download the sample <span class="blue">HTML</span> and <span class="blue">CSS</span> to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece
                (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your <span class="undrline">CSS</span> file to a web server under your control.
                <span class="blue">Send us a link</span> to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will
                download it and place it on our server.</p>

                <p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how
                amazing CSS really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web
                today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look
                forward to.</p>

                <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <span class="undrline">CSS 1 & 2</span> usage. <span class="undrline">CSS 3 & 4 </span>should be limited to
                widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about
                functional, practical <span class="undrline">CSS</span> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public.
                The only real requirement we have is that your CSS validates.Luckily, designing this way shows how well
                various browsers have implemented <span class="undrline">CSS</span> by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly
                consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these
                days — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every
                platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and
                the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).We ask that you
                submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum,
                and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We’re well past the point of
                needing another garden-related design.This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain
                full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see <span class="blue">submission guidelines</span>), but we ask you
                release your <span class="undrline">CSS</span> under a Creative Commons license identical to the one on this site so that others may
                learn from your work.</p>
