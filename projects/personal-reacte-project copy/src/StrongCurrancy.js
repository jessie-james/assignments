        <h2>Strong Vs Weak Currancy</h2>
            <p>A currency is classified as Strong when it is worth more than another countryâ€™s currency. For example, if the American dollar was worth half a pound, the pound would be considerably <span className ="green">Stronger</span> than the dollar.
            By that same token the American dollar would be considerably <span className="orange">Weaker</span> than the pound.  If you already have a weaker form of currency and you have to Exchange your money to the stronger form you will have less money.
                If you are using our scale remember the exchanges is better wth darker the green is on the left we weaker the exchange when  you have  the reds on the left.  We hope that this app will help you break down the curancy exchange.
