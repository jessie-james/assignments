            <p>
                Just because you have a strong currancy doesn't guarntee that you are set for sucsess. The market value fo goods also has a piece to play.
                Consider you are in the US (which has a relativly strong dollar). But the cost of  loaf of bread is much higher than in a country like Chile. Even thou Chile has a weaker currancy  than the US the market is cheaper. 
                Both are factors when considering anything from travel to investing. 
            </p>
            <p>While exchange rates are always chaning because the global stock market is in constant flux. Basic goods like bread. tend to  maintain a relativly steady value. that steady value is a good way to track a countries stability.
                Which can futher help you decide when to invest, travel, or even start exchanging money. Similar to our strong vs weak Scale  there is the second scale ratign the cost of a loaf of bread compared to the counties you are trying 
                to compare. This scale works the same some way. With dark green symbolying a cheap goods market on one end and Red being an expenive  market on the other. this is all based off of the cost of a loaf of bread in that Country.
