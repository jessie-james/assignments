            <p>Just because you have a strong currency doesn't guarantee that you are set for success. The market value of goods also has a piece to play.
                Consider you are in the US (which has a relatively strong dollar). But the cost of a loaf of bread <i className="fas fa-bread-slice"></i> is much higher than in a country like Chile. Even thou Chile has a weaker currency than the US the market in Chile is cheaper. </p>
            <p>While exchange rates are always changing, basic goods like <i className="fas fa-bread-slice"></i> tend to maintain a relatively steady value. Then can help you decide when to invest, travel, or even start exchanging money. Check out our Second scale which compares <i className="fas fa-bread-slice"></i> costs in different countries.
                This scale works the same way as $$ ratings on food. The more<i className="fas fa-bread-slice"></i> symbols The better the market and the more you can buy.</p>
