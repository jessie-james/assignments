        <h2>Strong Vs Weak Currancy</h2>
        <p>
            A currency is classified as strong when it is worth more than another countryâ€™s currency. For exsample if the American dollar was worth half a pound, the pound would be considerably <span>stronger</span> than the dollar.
            By that same token the American dollar would be considerably <span>weaker</span> than the pound. This if you are going from a strong form of currancy to a Weaker form of currancy you will be able to buy more when using the 
            weaker for. if you already have a weaker form of currancy and you have to Exchange your money to the stronger form you will have less money to work with in tath country. So it's great for you as a consumer or tourist, If your counties from of currancy is strong than it tends to buy more abroad. 
            Often things will feel cheaper to you.
