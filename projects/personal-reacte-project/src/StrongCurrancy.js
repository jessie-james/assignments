        <h2>Strong Vs Weak Currancy</h2>
            <p>A currency is classified as Strong when it is worth more than another countryâ€™s currency. For example, if the American dollar was worth half a pound, the pound would be considerably <span className ="green">Stronger</span> than the dollar.
            By that same token the American dollar would be considerably <span className="orange">Weaker</span> than the pound.  If you already have a weaker form of currency and you have to Exchange your money to the stronger form you will have less money.
